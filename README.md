4. **Configure the plugin** according to your needs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Configuration (`config.yml`)

```yaml
# PocketEngine configuration file v1
enable-auto-world-management: false  # Enable automatic world management
setup-mode: true                     # Enable setup mode for development
minigame-name: "Minigame"           # Display name for your minigame

## üîß API Usage

### Game Management

```php
use JonasWindmann\PocketEngine\Main;
use JonasWindmann\PocketEngine\game\Game;

// Get the current game instance
$game = Main::getInstance()->game;

// Check game state
if ($game->gameState === GameState::WAITING) {
    // Game is waiting for players
}

// Add a player to the game
$game->join($player);

// Start the game manually
$game->start();

// End the game
$game->end();
```

### Spawn Point Management

```php
use JonasWindmann\PocketEngine\Main;
use pocketmine\math\Vector3;

$spawnManager = Main::getInstance()->getSpawnPointManager();

// Add a spawn point
$id = $spawnManager->addSpawnPoint(
    new Vector3(100, 64, 200),
    "VIP Spawn",
    "lobby",
    ["vip" => true, "region" => "north"],
    10,
    "vip"
);

// Get a spawn point
$spawnPoint = $spawnManager->getSpawnPoint($id);

// Remove a spawn point
$spawnManager->removeSpawnPoint($id);

// Get all spawn points
$allSpawns = $spawnManager->getAllItems();
```

### World Management

```php
use JonasWindmann\PocketEngine\Main;

$worldManager = Main::getInstance()->getWorldManager();

// Check if a world is required by PocketEngine
if ($worldManager->isRequiredWorld("lobby")) {
    // This world is managed by PocketEngine
}

// Get list of required worlds
$requiredWorlds = $worldManager->getRequiredWorlds(); // ["lobby", "game", "victory"]
```

### Configuration Access

```php
use JonasWindmann\PocketEngine\Main;

$config = Main::getInstance()->getConfigurationManager();

// Check if in setup mode
if ($config->isSetupMode()) {
    // Development mode is enabled
}

// Get game settings
$requiredPlayers = $config->getRequiredPlayers();
$roundTime = $config->getRoundTime();
$minigameName = $config->getMinigameName();
```

## üîê Permissions

### Basic Permissions
- **`pocketengine.use`** - Access to basic PocketEngine commands (default: op)
- **`pocketengine.spawnpoint.use`** - Access to spawn point management commands (default: op)

### Command-specific Permissions
All commands respect the permission system and will only be available to users with appropriate permissions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

PocketEngine follows a clean architecture pattern with several key components:

### Managers
- **ConfigurationManager**: Handles all configuration loading and validation
- **WorldManager**: Manages world creation, deletion, and configuration
- **SpawnPointManager**: Handles spawn point storage and retrieval
- **GameServiceManager**: Manages game-specific services and updates
- **ScoreboardSetupManager**: Sets up and configures scoreboards

### Game System
- **Game**: Core game logic and state management
- **GameState**: Enumeration of possible game states
- **GameListener**: Event handling for game-related events
- **GameUpdateTask**: Handles periodic game updates

### Components
- **PocketEngineComponent**: Player session component for game-specific data

## üîÑ Game Flow

1. **Initialization**: Plugin loads and initializes all managers
2. **World Setup**: Required worlds are created/configured
3. **Waiting State**: Game waits for minimum required players
4. **Starting State**: Countdown begins when enough players join
5. **Playing State**: Game is active, players are teleported to spawn points
6. **Ending State**: Game ends either by time limit or win condition
7. **Post-Game Countdown**: Configurable wait time with player notifications
8. **Reset**: All players kicked, game returns to waiting state for next round

## üéØ Post-Game Reset System

PocketEngine features an advanced post-game reset system that provides a smooth transition between rounds:

### Features
- **‚è±Ô∏è Configurable Countdown**: Set custom wait time after rounds end (default: 30 seconds)
- **üìä Live Scoreboard Updates**: Victory scoreboard shows countdown timer in real-time
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning System**: Title notifications at 30, 20, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 seconds before reset
- **üë• Automatic Player Management**: All remaining players are kicked with friendly messages
- **üîÑ Clean Reset**: Server returns to pristine waiting state, ready for new players

### How It Works
1. **Round Ends** - Players see victory/defeat titles and are moved to victory world
2. **Countdown Begins** - Victory scoreboard displays "Reset in: Xs" countdown
3. **Warnings Displayed** - Players receive title warnings at specified intervals
4. **Players Kicked** - Friendly kick message: "Round Over! The server is resetting for the next round. Rejoin to play again!"
5. **Server Reset** - Game state, player lists, and all variables reset to initial values
6. **Ready for Next Round** - New players can join immediately

### Configuration
```yaml
post-game-wait-time: 30  # Time in seconds (minimum: 5)
```

This system ensures players understand what's happening and when they can rejoin, creating a professional minigame experience.
